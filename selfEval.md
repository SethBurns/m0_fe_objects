# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

- This was pretty easy. I understood the assignment and felt comfortable doing this one fairly quickly.


- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

- I really struggled this morning due to not understanding the assignment properly. I was doing things I didn't have to do and was really challenging myself to 'improve' the functions. What it meant was clean up the syntax. What I did was rewrite the functions to do more and be more complicated. I was really frustrated when I learned I spent 2 hours working something that really took me 5 minutes. But I took a few needed breaks after that today and have been working efficiently. I'm doing well in this regard.


- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

- I want to remember that Arrays of Objects are a really useful way to store data that has many facets. It will be something I will use often, I can feel it.
